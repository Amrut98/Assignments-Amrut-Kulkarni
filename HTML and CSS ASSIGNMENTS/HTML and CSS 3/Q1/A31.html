                        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</b> born <b>24 April 1973</b> is an Indian former international cricketer who served as captain of the <b>Indian</b> national team.
                        He has conquered the greatest heights, battled the mightiest attacks and led a depleted army from the jaws of defeat into memorable victories. From Sydney to St. Lucia, Bombay to Bristol and from Colombo to Cape Town, he has battered and bruised them all.
                        Sachin’s success has been instrumental in India’s rise over the past two decades.
